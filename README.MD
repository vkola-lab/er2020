### Prerequisites

The tool was developed based on the following dependencies:

1. PyTorch (1.1 or greater).
2. NumPy (1.16 or greater).
3. Scipy (1.30 or greater)
4. OpenCV (3.4.2 or greater)
5. scikit-learn (0.21.2 or greater)

Please note that the dependencies require Python 3.6 or greater. We recommend installation and maintenance of all packages using [`conda`](https://www.anaconda.com/). For installation of GPU accelerated PyTorch, additional effort may be required. Please check the official websites of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) for detailed instructions.

### Data files
Original imaging file in .npy stored in:
```bash
data/raw/NAME_OF_SEQUENCE/*.npy
```

Registered imaging file in.npy stored in:
```bash
data/registered/NAME_OF_SEQUENCE/*.npy
```

Name of sequences contain
```bash
SAG_IW_TSE_LEFT & SAG_IW_TSE_RIGHT
```

## Examples
To start a new training job with learning rate of 1e-4, batch size of 64, and learning rate decay of 0.9
```bash
$ python main.py --lr 0.0001 --bs 64 --gamma 0.9
```
To perform linear registration
```bash
$ python main.py --r
```
To continue model training from a saved checkpoint:
```bash
$ python main.py --c
```
